# BarrowmanFlow
This program calculate rocket aerodynamics parameter.
Calculated using Barrowman method and Apparent Mass method based on slender body theory.

BarrowmanFlow is a library for calculating aerodynamics. It is necessary to prepare driving scripts.The script describes the shape of aerodynamic elements.

"simple_rocket.py" is a simple rocket calculation example.

"fin_optimize.py" is fin optimization example.
